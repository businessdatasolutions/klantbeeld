Immersive realities could allow brands to create more engaging and interactive experiences for their customers: vir- tual tours and events, utilizing AR rendering or a digital twin to try on clothing or furniture from the comfort of one’s home, or traveling anywhere at the drop of a hat with very little carbon footprint (or, for IRL trips, experiencing a digital overlay of recommendations, historical models and simula- tions, or just-in-time booking opportunities).” (“What We See - Future Today Institute” 2023)\n“New screen and spatial tracking technology could make it possible to show personalized information and wayfinding details in context. Partnering with Misapplied Sciences, Delta has piloted a “parallel reality” departure board at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Travelers scan a digital boarding pass as overhead sensors track their presence and position and relay personal- ized flight details on a multi-view pixel display; the display can simultaneously project different colors of light in different directions depending on where the viewer is standing. The display technology, combined with beacon tracking, could create the “Minority Report” vision for contextual advertising and wayfinding in stadiums, shopping centers, and more.” (“What We See - Future Today Institute” 2023)"
