	abstract = {Chief strategy officers and those responsible for shaping the direction of their organizations are often asked to facilitate “visioning” meetings. This helps teams brainstorm ideas, but it isn’t a substitute for critical thinking about the future. Neither are the one-, three-, or five-year strategic plans that have become a staple within most organizations, though they are useful for addressing short-term operational goals. Futurists think about time differently, and company strategists could learn from their approach. For any given uncertainty about the future — whether that’s risk, opportunity, or growth — we tend to think in the short- and long-term simultaneously. To do this, consider using a framework that doesn’t rely on linear timelines or simply mark the passage of time as quarters or years. Instead, use a time cone that measures certainty and charts actions.},

	abstract = {Consumer sentiment analysis is a recent fad for social media-related applications such as healthcare, crime, finance, travel, and in academia. Disentangling consumer perception to gain insight into the desired objective and reviews is significant. With the advancement of technology, a massive amount of social web data increasing in volume, subjectivity, and heterogeneity becomes challenging to process manually. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been utilized to handle this difficulty in real-life applications. This paper presents a study to determine the usefulness, scope, and applicability of this alliance of ML techniques for consumer sentiment analysis (CSA) for online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. We show a systematic literature review to compare, analyse, explore, and understand the attempts and directions to find research gaps in illustrating the future scope of this pairing. The primary objective is to read and analyse the use of ML techniques for consumer sentiment analysis on online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. This research has significant implications for service providers in terms of developing managerial strategies for consumers in terms of selecting services that meet their needs. Furthermore, there is high impact for researchers in terms of prospective research directions.},

Modern recommender systems evolved along with the growth of Information Technology and are contributing to all industry and service segments inclusive of travel and tourism. The journey started with generic recommender engines which gave way to personalized recommender systems and further advanced to contextualized personalization with advent of artificial intelligence. Current era is also witnessing a boom in social media usage and the social media big data is acting as a critical input for various analytics with no exception for recommender systems. This paper details about the study conducted on the evolution of travel recommender systems, their features and current set of limitations. We also discuss on the key algorithms being used for classification and recommendation processes and metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and thereby the recommenders.},

	abstract = {Purpose As algorithms permeate nearly every aspect of digital life, artificial intelligence (AI) systems exert a growing influence on human behavior in the digital milieu. Despite its popularity, little is known about the roles and effects of algorithmic literacy (AL) on user acceptance. The purpose of this study is to contextualize AL in the AI environment by empirically examining the role of AL in developing users' information processing in algorithms. The authors analyze how users engage with over-the-top (OTT) platforms, what awareness the user has of the algorithmic platform and how awareness of AL may impact their interaction with these systems. Design/methodology/approach This study employed multiple-group equivalence methods to compare two group invariance and the hypotheses concerning differences in the effects of AL. The method examined how AL helps users to envisage, understand and work with algorithms, depending on their understanding of the control of the information flow embedded within them. Findings Our findings clarify what functions AL plays in the adoption of OTT platforms and how users experience algorithms, particularly in contexts where AI is used in OTT algorithms to provide personalized recommendations. The results point to the heuristic functions of AL in connection with its ties in trust and ensuing attitude and behavior. Heuristic processes using AL strongly affect the credibility of recommendations and the way users understand the accuracy and personalization of results. The authors argue that critical assessment of AL must be understood not just about how it is used to evaluate the trust of service, but also regarding how it is performatively related in the modeling of algorithmic personalization. Research limitations/implications The relation of AL and trust in an algorithm lends strategic direction in developing user-centered algorithms in OTT contexts. As the AI industry has faced decreasing credibility, the role of user trust will surely give insights on credibility and trust in algorithms. To better understand how to cultivate a sense of literacy regarding algorithm consumption, the AI industry could provide examples of what positive engagement with algorithm platforms looks like. Originality/value User cognitive processes of AL provide conceptual frameworks for algorithm services and a practical guideline for the design of OTT services. Framing the cognitive process of AL in reference to trust has made relevant contributions to the ongoing debate surrounding algorithms and literacy. While the topic of AL is widely recognized, empirical evidence on the effects of AL is relatively rare, particularly from the user's behavioral perspective. No formal theoretical model of algorithmic decision-making based on the dual processing model has been researched.},
